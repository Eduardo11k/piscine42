# piscine42

Here's my piscine from school 42
I'm a self taught CS. Background, bachelor in sport science...THERE MAY BE BUGS ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
I rewrote at home the functions just to train my disturbing piscine experience, the code is not moulinetted!
Just ponder the overall mental process
This is my YT page where i try to deconstruct what i wrote-> https://www.youtube.com/@onaecO
Your suggestions for eventual improvements & co are much appreciated! Thx
